PROxIMA is a process modeling and simulation framework. It enables the optimization of the modeled processes for multi-paradigm semantic inconsistencies.

The features of the framework include:
 -  A visual process modeler based on the FTG+PM formalism that enables the modeling processes along with a formalism transformation graph as its strong type system.
 -  A fully modeled process enactment module.
 -  A process simulation and optimization module, with the ability to rewrite the process.
 -  The catalogue of inconsistency patterns and the catalogue of management patterns is fully extensible.
