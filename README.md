PROxIMA is a process modeling and simulation framework. It allows a mixed multi-objective optimization of process models for various metrics, including the consistency of the model artifacts passed around the process.

The features of the framework include:
 -  A visual process modeler based on the FTG+PM formalism that enables modeling processes along with a formalism transformation graph as its strong type system.
 -  A fully modeled process enactment module.
 -  A process simulation and optimization module, with the ability to rewrite and optimize the process.
 -  A fully extensible catalogue of inconsistency patterns and their corresponding management patterns.
